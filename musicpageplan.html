Our Plan
</h1>

<p>
For this project were are going to use a music api linked with our spotify accounts for our data. We will display this data using a "sort by" window on the left hand side of the screen for easy side by side navigation. The plan is to allow the user to click on the "artists", albums", songs", and "genres" tabs in this window to allow a filtering of the data. After clicking these tabs the user will be able to look at only that part of the data organized in alphabetical order. the user can scroll through and click on a data peice falling in the specified catagory and see the remaining information beside the data peice in the specified catagory. This allows the user to access what he or she wants to see first in order to perhaps seek more information.
</p>
<p>
we will use the if, else statements in ordert to sort the catagories' data in a table. we will then use the on click functions to display data yet to be seen after clicking through to find it.
<p>
this is the core of what we will be doing. We will use ample amount of remove functions to clear out unwanted data off the screen to allow the wanted data to be prevelant.
